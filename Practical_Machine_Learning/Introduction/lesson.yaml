- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think is a disadvantage of the Base Plotting System?
  AnswerChoices:  It's intuitive and exploratory; It mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data; You can't go back once a plot has started; A complicated plot is a series of simple R commands
  CorrectAnswer: You can't go back once a plot has started
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='You can\'t go back once a plot has started')
  Hint: Which choice has a negative contraction in it?


- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Use the R command head with airquality as an argument to see what the data looks like.
  CorrectAnswer: head(airquality)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(airquality)')
  Hint: Type head(airquality) at the command prompt.


- Class: figure
  Output: Now for the second plot.
  Figure: goodPlot1.R
  
- Class: script
  Output: The last R expression to be evaluated in a function will become the 
    return value of that function. We want this function to take one argument, 
    x, and return x without modifying it. Delete the pound
    sign so that x is returned without any modification. Make sure to save your
    script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: test_func1()
  Hint: Make sure to delete the pound sign so the last expression in the function is just x.
  Script: boring_function.R
