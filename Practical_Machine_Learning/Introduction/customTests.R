## Here we include "unit tests" for functions that the user will have to write in the lesson

# EXAMPLE: This function tests the file "boring_function.R" that is stored in the scripts folder.
# The user has to complete the function body. The function below is used to test whether this was
# done correctly.

    t2 <- identical(func(4), 4)
    t3 <- identical(func(0), 0)
    ok <- all(t1, t2, t3)
  }, silent = TRUE)
  exists('ok') && isTRUE(ok)
}
